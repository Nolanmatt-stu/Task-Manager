This code is a multi-user task manager in which:

  - Users can be added and removed,
  - New tasks can be added and removed
  - Tasks can be viewed and edited
  - Reports and statistics regarding the list of tasks can be created in .txt files

Then once you have some users and a list of tasks, 
it can automatically generate new .txt files within the folder which show the statistics relating to the different users:
  - what their tasks are
  - what they involve
  - percentages that are done or are overdue
  - and more!

This program was created as one of the later "capstone" programs of my HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp
It showcases:
  - Lists
  - Functions
  - String Handling
  - File Handling
  - Importing Libraries 


Installation:

To test the program out for yourself, simply save the 3 files (the .py and two .txt files) locally to your device and open them as a workspace in any standard code editor (for example Visual Studio Code)
